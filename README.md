# My Configs
These are my settings I use for Counter-Strike 2/Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

---

## What does this file do?
`autoexec.cfg` - My autoexec/settings

`cs2_video.txt` - My video settings (allows Low Shadow Quailty + real time shadows)

> [!CAUTION]
> Valve has disabled text mods in CS2 on 12/14/23. I'm not sure when/if they will be re-enabled.

`csgo_ghostz.txt` - My custom language for custom colored text

`knifechanger.cfg` - Give yourself any knife in offline servers

## Where do I put these?
`autoexec.cfg`/`knifechanger.cfg` > `...\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg`

`cs2_video.txt` > `...\Steam\userdata\id\730\local\cfg`

> [!TIP]
> Workaround: rename `csgo_ghostz.txt` to `closecaption_english.txt` and place it in `...\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\resource\subtitles` (Create a `subtitles` folder)

`csgo_ghostz.txt` > `...\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\resource`
